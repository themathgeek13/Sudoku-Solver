# Sudoku-Solver
A Python program to solve Sudoku puzzles. A prequel (pre-program) to the computer vision based Sudoku Solver.

Initially created to solve 50 Sudoku puzzles for Project Euler's challenge, it evolved to a more robust solver.

It uses more logic than most programs, but eventually has to resort to brute force to get to the solution.
